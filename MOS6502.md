
The NES uses the MOS 6502 processor.
I'm putting my personal notes on the processor in this document for reference.

Registers:

Note: all registers are 8 bits except PC

PC program counter (16 bits)
P  Processor status
A  accumulator
X  index register X
Y  index register Y
SP Stack pointer

Memory:

$0000 - $00ff Addresses used by "Zero Page Addressing Instructions".
$0100 - $01ff The stack
$0200 - $fff9 Unspecified
$fffa - $fffb Address of non-maskable interrupt (NMI) handler
$fffc - $fffd Address of "reset"
$fffe - $ffff Address of BRK/IRQ handler


// Operations ------01
ORA A = A|M (Read M)
AND A = A&M (Read M)
EOR A = A^M (Read M)
ADC A = A+M (Read M)
STA M = A   (Write M)
LDA A = M   (Read M)
CMP M       (Read M)
SBC A = A-M-(1-C) (Read M)

// Operations ------10
     ---010-- (accum)   | the rest
------------------------|---------------
ASL  A = A<<1  (No M)   | M = M<<1  (ReadWrite M)
ROL  A = A<<<1 (No M)   | M = M<<<1 (ReadWrite M)
LSR  A = A>>1  (No M)   | M = M>>1  (ReadWrite M)
ROR  A = A>>>1 (No M)   | M = M>>>1 (ReadWrite M)
STX                     | M = X     (Write M) 
LDX                     | X = M     (Read M)
DEC                     | M = M-1   (ReadWrite M)
INC                     | M = M+1   (ReadWrite M)
