The NES uses the MOS 6502 processor.
I'm putting my personal notes on the processor in this document for reference.

Registers:

Note: all registers are 8 bits except PC

PC program counter (16 bits)
P  Processor status
A  accumulator
X  index register X
Y  index register Y
SP Stack pointer

Memory:

$0000 - $00ff Addresses used by "Zero Page Addressing Instructions".
$0100 - $01ff The stack
$0200 - $fff9 Unspecified
$fffa - $fffb Address of non-maskable interrupt (NMI) handler
$fffc - $fffd Address of "reset"
$fffe - $ffff Address of BRK/IRQ handler


// Operations ------01
ORA A = A|M (Read M)
AND A = A&M (Read M)
EOR A = A^M (Read M)
ADC A = A+M (Read M)
STA M = A   (Write M)
LDA A = M   (Read M)
CMP M       (Read M)
SBC A = A-M-(1-C) (Read M)

// Operations ------10
     ---010-- (accum)   | the rest
------------------------|---------------
ASL  A = A<<1  (No M)   | M = M<<1  (ReadWrite M)
ROL  A = A<<<1 (No M)   | M = M<<<1 (ReadWrite M)
LSR  A = A>>1  (No M)   | M = M>>1  (ReadWrite M)
ROR  A = A>>>1 (No M)   | M = M>>>1 (ReadWrite M)
STX                     | M = X     (Write M) 
LDX                     | X = M     (Read M)
DEC                     | M = M-1   (ReadWrite M)
INC                     | M = M+1   (ReadWrite M)

## Interrupts

There are 3 kinds of interrupts:

IRQ (maskable interrupts)
* Generated by certain memory mappers.
* Ignored if the interrupt disable flags is set.
* Can be triggered by software with the BRK (Break) instruction.
* When occurs, system jumps to address at $FFFE and $FFFF.

NMI (non-maskable interrupt)
* Generated by PPU when Vblank occurs (at the end of each frame).
* Not affected by the interrupt disable flag.
* Note that the PPU NMI can still be disabled by clearing bit 7 of control register 1 ($2000).
* When occurs, system jumps to address located at $FFFA and $FFFB.

Reset interrupt
* Generated when the system powers on and when the user presses the reset button.
* When occurs, system jumps to address located at $FFFC and $FFFD.
